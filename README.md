# Sparking-Zero-Audio-Importer
The Sparking Zero Audio Importer simplifies adding custom music to Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO. It automates .wav to .hca conversion (VGAudioCli), song replacement, and mod setup for Reloaded II with Ryo Framework. Thanks to the devs for VGAudioCLI, Reloaded II and Ryo Framework as this tool probably wouldn't exist without their work.
